        <h2>Phase 0: Requirement Specifications</h2>
        <p>
            Using Vue.js, build a weather app that dynamically changes and reports the weather for the user's current
            location. This we application will access two APIs - a weather database and a geolocation database. By
            utilizing the geolocation database through latitude and longitude, the application will gain the user's
            location, then the application will access the weather database to get the current weather for that
            location. Then, the application will use that location and get the following 5 days worth of 3-hour
            forecasts.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each 3-hour forecast will have a dynamically created <code>div</code> block that will initially be gray. The
            user may click to "vote" on if they believe the weather will be that way in the future. The div will then
            change colors: green for a "likely" vote, red for "unlikely", and grey for neutral. These colors will just
            switch based on clicks. Additionally, there will be a vote counter above these divs that will keep track of
            how many likelies, unlicklies, and neutrals, changing with each click on a <code>div</code>.
