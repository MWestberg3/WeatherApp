        <h2>Phase 0: Requirement Specifications</h2>
        <p>
            Using Vue.js, build a weather app that dynamically changes and reports the weather for the user's current
            location. This we application will access two APIs - a weather database and a geolocation database. By
            utilizing the geolocation database through latitude and longitude, the application will gain the user's
            location, then the application will access the weather database to get the current weather for that
            location. Then, the application will use that location and get the following 5 days worth of 3-hour
            forecasts.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each 3-hour forecast will have a dynamically created <code>div</code> block that will initially be gray. The
            user may click to "vote" on if they believe the weather will be that way in the future. The div will then
            change colors: green for a "likely" vote, red for "unlikely", and grey for neutral. These colors will just
            switch based on clicks. Additionally, there will be a vote counter above these divs that will keep track of
            how many likelies, unlicklies, and neutrals, changing with each click on a <code>div</code>.

        <h2>Phase 2: Implementation</h2>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li> I learned that you can call functions in the html class attribute </li>
            <li> I learned that vue is very intuitive and there is a lot you can do to dynamically change the html output.</li>
            <li> Perhaps the coolest thing I learned is how to use vue to dynamically create html elements.</li>

        <h2>Phase 3: Testing/Debugging</h2>
        <p>
            Main issues I had was changing the status of the 5 day forecast. I had to scrap what I did (initially a .setAttribute) and rethink my strategy. I ended up adding an array to the data() with the likelihood status for each item in forecasts and I had to add a helper method that would return the status of the array. Additionally, I needed to add a coutner to update the overall value of how many likekly, unlikely, and neutral responses.

            deployed to git.

        <h2>Phase 5: Maintenance</h2>
        <p>
            I think that this assignment is very intuitive. I added some protections so if the location api does not retrieve the region, city, or country, the longitude and latitude values are still grabbed. If any value is not grabbed, it is simple to tell which value needs to be grabbed, which allows for simpler debugging. I also did not hardcode any numbers, allowing for complete dynamicism of the overall application.
